Matthew lifted his foot off the gas pedal, inching the car forward. The re-entry point was only a few hundred feet away, but at this pace it would take upwards of an hour. Past the border it was just another five hours until he would be home and asleep in his own bed.

But for now, Matthew was an uncomfortable combination of tired and restless. His car's self-driving functionality would be disabled until he crossed the border, so he couldn't take a nap or disappear into a vid. He was also out of signal range, and sick of every song saved locally. So he waited in silence, crawling forward, just a few dozen cars to go.

Your connection has been restored, his car spoke to him, while text flashed on the windshield to accompany it. Please verify your identity.

Matthew hesitated.

A week before, Matthew's car hurtled down the last stretch of US space. Vanessa's messages remained unread on the windshield:

<ChatMessages />

"Call Vanessa," Matthew said.

"Hello?" Came her voice. "Where are you dad? You're not coming, are you?"

"I'm not sweetie. I'm not." He steeled himself for her reaction.

"Why?" She croaked.

"I got called to help set up a hospital. I dreaded telling you..."

"It's not that hard to text."

"I'm sorry."

"Why'd it have to be now? I haven't seen you since..." Her voice trailed off.

"I don't know."

"It's just not fair!"

"Van, please–"

"Dad, let me–"

Your connection has been terminated.

Self-driving capabilities are now disabled.

Welcome to BajaX.

"Matthew Johnson," he said, uttering his passphrase, "yellow monkeys play guitar."

Identity verified. United State Citizen. You have fifteen-thousand four-hundred and two unread emails… Three unread messages… One missed call.

"Filter, messages from Vanessa."

Hellooooooooooo? Vanessa's messages flashed up on the windshield in grand white text, shoving the rest of the interface aside. R u dead???

Matthew sighed, rejecting the option to send the emoji that corresponded to his body language. He knew how that conversation would go. Tomorrow, he resolved, after he had slept in a real bed and taken a hot shower.

She was still awake. All he'd have to do was speak, or tap; but if he did that, they would get into an argument and he wouldn't even be able to sleep. Instead, he reclined his car seat and watched the stars and satellites move across the sky, trying to figure out which one was which.

-----

Your destination is on your right, Matthew's car said as the door slid up. A light yellow townhouse framed with squared-off bushes. He kneeled down to slip the letter under the door.

"Hello," came a voice from above, and Matthew almost fell backwards.

An old lady stood in the doorway, propping herself up with a cane. Her skin was wrinkled like a prune. "I'm Sabrina, Alejandro's grandmother."

How did she know I was coming? Matthew spun around, paranoid. Was this a trap? He had knowingly helped a family break the law. He handed her the letter. "I should go," he said.

"No no no," she said. "You should come in."

"Sorry, but I really think I should just go home and sleep. I'm not thinking straight."

"Hello," a voice echoed from behind Sabrina.

"He would certainly love it if you came in," Sabrina said, stepping aside.

"I don't think–" Matthew's breath caught. There was the boy. Right in the middle of the living room.

"How did you get here?" Matthew asked. Something was off. Was he wearing different clothes? Alejandro was shaking. No, shimmering. He saw the lights now, coming down from the corners of the ceiling.

"I'm a hologram," the boy shouted. He stepped forward and attempted to grab his grandmother's hand.

"You didn't tell him?" Sabrina asked.

"If I told him," Alejandro said, "he wouldn't have said yes."

"Explain," Sabrina said, crossing her arms, "and apologize."

"I'm allowed to holo across the border because I'm a citizen," Alejandro said. "I was born here. Without me, we couldn't deliver the letters. My abuelo is too old to do it himself."

"But why bother with the letters at all," Matthew asked. "If you can holo?"

"Why don't you come in, Matthew?" Sabrina said. "It's cold out."

"You don't say no to abuela," Alejandro said.

-----

They sat around a sparse dining table, and Matthew sipped at a cup of steaming tea, his legs fidgeting under the table as Sabrina read the letter in silence. He watched her eyes, but they betrayed nothing.

"Thank you," she said finally, folding up the letter carefully.

"You're welcome," Matthew replied awkwardly. "And I'm sorry, for what our country did to you."

"My daughter's asleep, upstairs," Sabrina said, waving the comment away. "Alejandro is hers." She let one hand rest next to the letter, and the boy's image grasped at it as much as it could. "He was born here, but he spends the summers with my husband. It's important for him to understand where he came from."

"I could just watch a vid," the boy grumbled.

"Believe me dear, I would love to run my hands through your real hair," she said, stroking the virtual representation. Alejandro tried to shake her off, then feigned defeat and laid down in her lap. "Without him," Sabrina said, "we would have lost touch long ago. You're right, of course. While the government does not allow my husband to holo, Alejandro could act as our conduit. But our relationship is... sacred. There are parts of it no one else deserves to know. Not Alejandro, the government, credit profilers, you. For that purpose, only the letters suffice." Matthew nodded, tried to stop fidgeting.

"Of course we would prefer to talk all the time," she continued. "But we've discovered there is a magic to writing. It's never too much too quick. Sometimes we used to hate each other. We couldn't stand talking to each other. But a letter… I'm never angry at him when I'm done writing a letter. Not once, in fifteen years. My anger can never make it all the way down the length of my arm and onto the paper. You must understand."

"I have a daughter," Matthew said. "I haven't seen her in two years, since the divorce. But we're in the same country. We could visit each other."

"You should give it a try," Sabrina said. She pushed herself up against the table, gripping her cane tightly with one hand. "Here, I'll walk you out."

-----

Matthew couldn't get to sleep, even though it was almost four in the morning. His daughter's face still glowed green on the windshield. He swiveled the seat around to face an empty desk and reached underneath to pick out a clean sheet of paper. It took him a minute to find a pen, hidden at the very back of the drawer; rolling it between his fingers, he realized it had never been used.
