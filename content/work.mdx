I started Gumroad in 2011. In 2015, we reached a peak of 23 full-time employees. In 2016, after [failing](/reflecting) to raise more money, I ended up back where I began: a one-person company.

Today, when I'm asked how many people work at Gumroad, I respond with "ten or so." That's how I convert the number of people we have into what others expect. But the truth is more complicated:

If we include everyone who works on Gumroad, it's 25.

If we include full-time employees, it's none. Not even me.

We have no meetings, and no deadlines either.

And it's working: our creators earn over $175 million a year, and we generate $11 million in annualized revenue, growing 85% year-over-year.

That said, I don't expect anyone to copy our way of working wholesale. We got here on accident, not some grand plan.

However, I do think there are pieces of our story and the way we work that could benefit other companies, their people, and—most importantly—their customers.

## Freedom at all costs

After the layoffs in 2015, even though the team shrunk, Gumroad itself continued to grow.

<Image src="/2018-earnings.png" alt="2018 earnings" />

But hiring people full-time and leasing a new office in San Francisco to work out of was untenable. Instead, I found an Indian firm called [BigBinary](https://bigbinary.com/) and hired a few engineers as contractors.

These contractors saved the company. They fixed bugs and maintained the site while I answered support tickets, designed features, and wrote about new initatives.

Eventually, I hired back the same customer support person we had from before the layoffs, this time via an hourly contracting agreement too.

Meanwhile, I [moved to Utah](/bubble) and attempted to become a full-time creator.

While Gumroad was no longer on track to become a billion-dollar company, I acquired a new asset: time. I used that time to take classes on writing and painting.

Because I was burned out and didn't want to think about working any more than I needed to, I instituted a no-meeting, no-deadline culture.

For me, it was no longer about growth at all costs, but "freedom at all costs."

This way, Gumroad stayed profitable, I could take a much-needed break to explore my hobbies, and the product continued to improve over time.

## How we work

Today, working at Gumroad resembles working on an open source project like Rails. Except it's neither open source, nor unpaid.

Instead of having meetings, people "talk" to each other via GitHub, Notion, and (occasionally) Slack, expecting responses within 24 hours. Because there are no standups or "syncs" and some projects can involve expensive feedback loops to collaborate, working this way requires clear and thoughtful communication.

Everyone writes well, and writes *a lot*.

There are no deadlines either. We ship incrementally, and launch things whenever the stuff in development is better than what's currently in production. The occasional exception does exist, such as a tax deadline, but as a rule, I try not to tell anyone what to do or how fast to do it. When someone new joins the company, they do what everyone else does: go into our Notion queue, pick a task, and get to work, asking for clarification when needed.

## A company of creators

One day, out of the blue, I received an email from [Daniel Vassallo](https://twitter.com/dvassallo). I knew Daniel; he was a creator who had made over $250,000 on Gumroad in less than a year.

He was already using the product—so he understood what problems Gumroad ought to solve next—and he had some ideas for how he could help out:

> I love Gumroad (and I'm living off it!), I enjoy product scoping and strategy, and I think I can take over your PM tasks. I would only be able to dedicate around 2hrs/day on average, but I'd be available daily. Don't know if this is the type of commitment you had in mind, but I figured if there's a place where this arrangement can work, it's Gumroad :)

It was a perfect fit. Daniel became our new Head of Product.

It can be a great deal for Gumroad too. Before Daniel quit his job at Amazon, he was making over $400,000 a year. We pay him $120,000 a year.

How? He works ten hours a week for us. In his words:

## Getting paid

In practice, we pay everyone hourly based on their role. The range varies from $50 (customer support) to $250 (Head of Product) an hour.

Recently I standardized our rates world-wide:

<Tweet id="1334201934702493697" />

This rate is agreed upon during our interview process:

1. Apply via a form.
2. An unpaid, few-hour challenge, that resembles the high-level work we do at Gumroad. This may include breaking down a large shipment (like Gumroad Memberships) into its atomic parts, planning the schema associated with a new feature, or writing up a Help Center article.
3. A paid, few-week trial period, that resembles the day-to-day work we do at Gumroad. This may include fixing bugs, shipping a feature, or answering support tickets.

*Note: We'll be hiring for more positions soon! [Follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/shl) for updates.*

Within the company, we keep a document that lists how much everyone is paid, along with their average working hours. This allows the team to have as much information as I do when making compensation decisions.

There are no perks of any kind, besides the flexibility and the cash.

To be clear, we don't provide healthcare. Everyone who works at Gumroad is responsible for their own healthcare and benefits. Everyone also pays for their own phone, laptop, internet connection, and all the other things they need.

There is another downside to this system: people have to track their hours. Some people solve this by billing 20 hours a week, even though they may work a bit more or a bit less. Others track it diligently, in 15-minute increments, and send a detailed invoice every week.

Since Daniel joined as quarter-time Head of Product, we've had [Randall Kanna](https://twitter.com/RandallKanna) join as quarter-time Head of Community and [Philip Kiely](https://twitter.com/philip_kiely) join as quarter-time Head of Marketing. They're successful Gumroad creators too.

At some point, it clicked: Creators make money so they can make stuff, instead of the other way around. Why not adopt this framing at Gumroad, too?

This is what *working in the creator economy* should feel like.

## The future of work is not working

Recently, I pitched the whole company about going full-time, because it felt wrong to grow any larger without full-time staff.

Nobody accepted.

I realized then that I was trying to copy the status quo—to try and fix something that wasn't broken—so that I could feel better about doing things the "normal" way.

But the deal we already had in place was better for what our people prioritize: freedom over growth, sustainability over speed, life over work.

[Gumroad's homepage](https://gumroad.com/) is clear about its benefits to creators who use it: "Escape your 9-to-5 job. Take off your suit and tie. End your commute. Get paid for your craft."

As cliché as it may be, we are trying to be a company of creators, for creators.

The internet has enabled new ways of working, but we're just starting to see them unfold. There are a lot of different ways to make work work. Ours is just one.
