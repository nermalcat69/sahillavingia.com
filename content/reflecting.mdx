In 2011, I left my job as the second employee at Pinterest — before I vested any of my stock — to work on what I thought would be my life's work.

I thought Gumroad would become a billion-dollar company, with hundreds of employees. It would IPO, and I would work on it until I died. Something like that.

Needless to say, that didn't happen.

Now, it may look like I am in an enviable position, running a profitable, growing, low-maintenance software business serving adoring customers. But for years, I considered myself a failure. At my lowest point, I had to lay off 75 percent of my company, including many of my best friends. I had failed.

It took me years to realize I was misguided from the outset. I no longer feel shame in the path I took to get to where I am today — but for a long time, I did. This is my journey, from the beginning.

## A weekend project turned VC-backed startup

The idea behind Gumroad was simple: Creators and others should be able to sell their products directly to their audiences with quick, simple links. No need for a storefront.

I built Gumroad the weekend I thought up the idea, and launched it early Monday morning on Hacker News. The reaction exceeded my grandest aspirations. Over 52,000 people checked it out on the first day.

Later that year, I left my job as the second employee at Pinterest — before I vested any of my stock — to turn Gumroad into what I thought would become my life's work.

Almost immediately, I raised $1.1M from an all-star cast of angel investors and venture capital firms, including Max Levchin, Chris Sacca, Ron Conway, Naval Ravikant, Collaborative Fund, Accel Partners, and First Round Capital. A few months later, in May 2012, we raised $7M more. Mike Abbott from Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers (KPCB), a top-tier VC firm, led the round.

I was on top of the world. I was just 19, a solo founder, with over $8M in the bank and three employees. The world was starting to take note.

We grew the team. We stayed focused on our product. The monthly numbers started to climb. And then, at some point, they didn't.

To keep the product alive, I laid off 75 percent of my company — including many of my best friends. It really sucked. But I told myself things would be fine: The product would continue to grow and no one far from the company would ever find out.

Then, TechCrunch got wind of the layoffs and published "Layoffs Hit Gumroad As The E-Commerce Startup Restructures." All of a sudden, my failure was public. I spent the week ignoring my support network and answering our customers' concerns, many of whom relied on us to power their businesses. They wanted to know if they should look for alternative products. Some of our favorite, most successful creators left. This hurt, but I don't blame them for trying to minimize the risk in their own businesses.

So what exactly went wrong, and when?

## Failing in style

Let's start with the numbers. This is our monthly processed volume, until the layoffs:

That looks like a success, right? Up and to the right and all that? Sure, but it wasn't growing fast enough for venture capital.

Despite having a great product that customers loved, we had failed to build a *billion-dollar company*. And once we passed that threshold, there was no going back.

The only way to keep the company going was to fire everyone. The product had to get better, but it had to be done with no resources. We had to go from a burn of $230,000 a month (including all employees fully-loaded, an office, etc.) to about $9,000 a month (primarily servers and payment processing fees).

## Life after death

I kept going. Some of our core team stayed on as contractors, including our head of product and engineering. Miraculously, the product continued to improve. By that point, we had figured out our product-market fit: indie creators using Gumroad to sell directly to their audience with quick, simple links.

Our new strategy was clear: focus on the creators who were already successful, help them make more money, and take a small percentage of their success.

We built features that made their lives better: reduce fraud, improve analytics, fix bugs, and add highly-requested features. And with every month it became more clear there was an opportunity to build a great business, just not a *billion-dollar* business.

## The rise of the "small giants"

I started reading about companies that chose to be great instead of big. I learned about a whole world of companies that rejected traditional "Silicon Valley" definitions of success.

I read Bo Burlingham's [Small Giants](https://www.amazon.com/Small-Giants-Companies-Instead-10th-Anniversary/dp/014310960X), about companies that choose to be great instead of big. I learned about a whole world of companies that had picked a different path: to be great instead of big, to focus on being the best at what they do instead of the biggest.

I was particularly inspired by Basecamp and Mailchimp — companies that had become cultural icons and built incredible businesses by focusing on their product, their customers, and their team, instead of fundraising and growth at all costs.

## A new hope

In 2016, Gumroad became profitable. In 2017, even though we were only seven people, we generated $5.2 million in revenue and were profitable again.

And this year, with an average of only five people, we will do over $7 million. We're not growing 40% month over month, but we are growing 40% year over year, and that's nothing to be ashamed about.

## Redefining success

Today, when I'm asked for advice by aspiring entrepreneurs, I tell them:

"It's easier to build a $10 million business than a $1 billion business. And the $10 million business has a higher likelihood of making you happier."

Most of the time, they don't believe me. They think I'm just trying to make myself feel better about my own failure. But I'm not. I'm trying to save them from making the same mistake I did.

I'm not the only one who has learned this lesson. Many of my friends who have built "successful" startups are actually quite unhappy. They're stressed out, burnt out, and wondering if it was all worth it.

## The future

Today, Gumroad is a small, profitable company. We help creators earn over $175 million a year, and we take a small percentage of that to keep the lights on.

<Image src="/1_jFEJk5LRqwWXnvHXkwc8oA.png" alt="Creator earnings chart" />

We have no meetings, and no deadlines. People work on what they want, when they want. And it's working: we're growing steadily, and our creators are earning more money than ever.

We also give back to our community. We've donated over $100,000 to different causes. We raised money for the hurricane relief efforts in Puerto Rico and the floods in Kerala. We helped fund the Presence-of-Blackness project in speculative fiction, and a Mexicanx publication.

## Seeking the non-binary

For years, my only metric of success was building a billion-dollar company. Now, I realize that was a terrible goal. It's completely arbitrary and doesn't accurately reflect impact.

I'm not making an excuse or pretending that I didn't fail. I'm not pretending that failure feels good. Everyone knows that the failure rate in startups — especially venture-funded ones — is super high, but it still sucks when you don't reach your goals.

I failed, but I also succeeded at many other things. Gumroad turned $10 million of investor capital into $178 million (and counting) for creators. Without a fundraising goal coming up, we're simply focused on building the best product we can for our customers. On top of all that, I'm happy creating value beyond our revenue-generating product (like these words you're reading).

I consider myself "successful" now. Not exactly in the way I intended, though I think what I'm doing now counts.

Where did my singular focus on building a billion-dollar company come from in the first place? I think I inherited it from a society that worships wealth. I don't think it's a coincidence that Bill Gates was my all-time hero and the world's richest person. Ever since I can remember, I've equated "success" with net worth. If I heard someone say "that person's really successful," I didn't assume they were improving the well-being of those around them, but that they'd found a way to make a ton of cash.

Wealth can be a measure of being able to improve the well-being of those around you, as seems to be the case for someone like Bill Gates, who has invested heavily in philanthropy. But it's not the only way to measure success, nor is it the best one.

There's nothing wrong with trying to build the next Microsoft. I personally don't think billionaires are evil. And there's a part of me that wishes I was still on that path.

But for better or worse, I'm on this one now.
