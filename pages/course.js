          The Minimalist Entrepreneur
        </h2>

        <p>If you follow me, you know I care about mostly one thing: more people should be starting their own businesses. Gumroad helps people do that. My fund helps people do that.</p>

        <p>This course is about helping people do that.</p>

        <p>The goal of this course is to help you think differently about entrepreneurship. It exists because I had to think differently about how to construct my life–and my work–before I got happy.</p>

        <p>This course is not about raising tens of millions of VC dollars, nor is it about building a one-person powered-by-Amazon dropshipping business. There's nothing wrong with that, but this course is about <strong>how to build a sustainable business that matters</strong>.</p>

        <h2>Curriculum</h2>

        <p>This is a four-week course, consisting of eight classes:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>The minimalist business.</strong>
            <p>The real problems with VC-driven startups and IPOs from the perspective of someone who traveled that road (and then skidded right off). Also, on the irony of a “lifestyle” business.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Community first.</strong>
            <p>Designing a vision for your business by working backward from problems worth solving for people worth solving problems for.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Make something they need.</strong>
            <p>Leveraging your experiences and assets as an entrepreneur to hit the ground running.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Sell to your first 100 customers.</strong>
            <p>Don’t launch, sell. Debunking the myth of “virality” and how to market your business like a grown-up.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Market like a minimalist.</strong>
            <p>Turn strangers into fans, and fans into customers. For free.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Grow sustainably.</strong>
            <p>No profits = no payroll = no business. Letting go of Silicon Valley sloppiness and acing the fundamentals: operations, legal, finance.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Build the house you want to live in.</strong>
            <p>Getting the culture to fit without ever using the word “culture-fit.”</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The moral company.</strong>
            <p>On the ethical significance of providing a product in return for payment. And exploring what comes next.</p>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>It's going to be intense. We'll meet every Tuesday and Thursday from February 2nd to February 25th, at 9AM PST.</p>

        <h2>Topics that will be covered</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>Bootstrapping a customer-focused startup that solves real problems for paying customers</li>
          <li>Finding and vetting a business idea that leverages your unique strengths as an inherent competitive advantage</li>
          <li>Creating and leveraging a strong community of customers to kick-start your business’ growth</li>
          <li>Successful sales tactics since sales is the best way to build your early traction, not Facebook ads or viral tricks</li>
          <li>Marketing without costs by turning your strangers into your fans, and fans into customers</li>
          <li>How to nail fundamentals like operations, legal and finance so you can maintain profitability as you scale</li>
          <li>Building a company culture that isn’t about beanbags and snacks</li>
          <li>Using modern workplace options such as remote work and fractional work to build an awesome team without a high full-time headcount</li>
        </ul>

        <p>After taking this course (if not during it!), you will be able to start your own business to serve a community, ship a value-additive product for them, and sell it to a hundred customers.</p>

        <h2>Cohort-based courses</h2>
        <p>There's no way I could do this alone. Besides my co-instructor Julie Moscow, I am working with a <a href="https://www.notion.so/Q4-2020-Fund-Update-ba25f36011a946bbaa6c0f2c4d228687#1781ff8e66454722832bc66aebcfa46d">new startup</a> by AltMBA co-founder Wes Kao and Udemy co-founder Gagan Biyani to make this course happen.</p>
        <p>The benefits include...</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Learn with a Cohort of Peers</strong>
            <p>This course is designed to facilitate peer learning and interaction through Zoom breakout groups, an active online community and group projects</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Active Learning, not Passive Lecture Watching</strong>
            <p>Sahil won’t just talk at you, but rather engage via live Q&amp;A, so this feels more like an interactive seminar than a massive lecture hall</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Accountability and Feedback</strong>
            <p>You’re an entrepreneur. You can figure things out when you have to, but sometimes it’s helpful to have feedback and accountability to increase your chances of success.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Guest Lecturers</strong>
            <p>There'll be guests who will come in and provide different perspectives on how to be a Minimalist Entrepreneur.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>But this is ultimately my course, and I will work hard and be present to improve the experience as much as I can.</p>

        <h2>Frequently-asked questions</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Who are you?</strong>
            <p>I'm the founder and CEO of Gumroad, a service that helps creators get paid for their work–to the tune of $175 million a year. Before that, I was the second employee at Pinterest and built Pinterest for iPhone.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Who is this course for?</strong>
            <p>This course is for people who want to build meaningful, sustainable businesses, and who are willing to put in the hard work and time to make that happen.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Who isn't this for?</strong>
            <p>People who are trying to build billion-dollar companies to "change the world." Or people who are trying to "get rich quick." Or people who are trying to work four hours a week.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>What's the time commitment like?</strong>
            <p>It's at least two hour-long Zoom classes–Tuesdays and Thursdays at 9AM PST–with assignments, every week. The more you put in, the more you'll get out. I would recommend 5-7 hours a week dedicated to this class, if not more.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
