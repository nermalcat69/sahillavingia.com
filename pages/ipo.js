          <strong>The Creator-Owner Economy: Gumroad’s "IPO"</strong>
        </h2>

        <p>Creators deserve to get paid for their work.</p>
        <p>To date, <a href="https://gumroad.com">Gumroad</a> has made it easy by enabling creators to sell digital products, online courses, and memberships directly to their audience. But earning an income isn't the only way to get paid.</p>
        <p>Owning equity in a business is another.</p>
        <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">You’re not going to get rich renting out your time. You must own equity - a piece of a business - to gain your financial freedom.</p>&mdash; Naval (@naval) <a href="https://twitter.com/naval/status/1002103670400417792?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 31, 2018</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
        <h2>From income to equity</h2>
        <p>The last time I tried to raise money, I <a href="/reflecting">failed</a>. After meeting with dozens of investors and getting dozens of nos, we wrote off a Series B and had to either sell, shut down, or get acquired. As I wrote then:</p>
        <blockquote>I was accountable to our creators, our employees, and our investors–in that order.</blockquote>
        <p>Spoiler alert: I chose our creators over our employees and our investors, deciding not to sell the company. Instead, I shrunk the team from 20 to five–and later five to one, before building back up to 27 now–in order to keep serving our creators.</p>
        <p>It was a painful decision, but it was the right one. While it was tempting for me and others to Gumroad down and start anew, creators deserved to get paid–and many were counting on their income from Gumroad.</p>
        <p>In the years since I’ve often thought about how to make interests align more cleanly. Recently I <a href="/work">hired a few of our top creators</a> to run various parts of Gumroad.</p>
        <p>A logical next step: allowing them to become Gumroad investors too.</p>
        <p>In the words of the newest Gumroadian, Raul Popadineți: "I became a Gumroad creator in January. Two days ago I became an angel investor at Gumroad, and now the circle is complete."</p>
        <h2>Turning creators into owners</h2>
        <p>Why now? As of March 15 2021, the SEC allows companies to raise up to $5M from the public, using Regulation Crowdfunding (Reg CF). Startups are now also allowed to "test the waters," making sure demand is there before commiting to spinning up a campaign.</p>
        <p>Gumroad took advantage of these new rules as soon as it could. Even with a cap of $1K per investor, we hit the new limit in just about 12 hours, from 7,300 investors–including thousands of Gumroad creators.</p>
        <p><img src="/republic.png" style={{margin: "1rem 0"}} /></p>
        <p>(Separately, we raised $1M from Naval Ravikant, Jason Fried, and others, bringing the total amount raised in this "IPO" to $6M. All of this capital was raised at a $100M pre-money valuation.</p>
        <p>That also includes over 5,800 people for whom this was their first angel investment.</p>
        <p>I thought about calling this our Series C–for creators, community, crowdfunding, and out of respect for our failed Series B. But I think it's more accurate to say that this is our version of an "IPO," or initial public offering.</p>
        <p>There's one part missing: post-IPO liquidity. But liquidity is coming. An underreported fact of Reg CF is that it allows for secondary sales after a 1-year lockup period. Gumroad will soon allow owners to buy and sell in somewhat of a "free market."</p>
        <p>In that future, I think we'll need to revisit our language around "going public"–it will no longer be an atomic event.</p>
        <h2>The future of fundraising</h2>
        <p>I hope to see more startups raise money from their customers and communities. And not just startups, but restaurants and coffee shops and bookstores and more mature companies, and even venture capital firms like Arlan Hamilton's Backstage.</p>
        <p>Why isn’t it more common? First off, the legislation is a day old. It’ll take some time to get both sides of the marketplace–founders and retail investors–warmed up.</p>
        <p>There are other reasons too:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>It requires a lot of financial transparency–<em>I publish our financials already</em></li>
          <li>Having thousands of investors may create external pressure around decision-making around things like moderation, deplatforming, and pricing–<em>We’re very open about our decision-making already with our Open Board Meetings, encouraging feedback</em></li>
          <li>The brand and experience of VCs are often preferred by founders over the general public when selling customers, employees, etc–<em>I’ve raised money from VCs before, and can get the help I need (I’m kind of one myself!)</em></li>
          <li>You need to have high confidence you can reach a large audience of retail investors–<em>With “testing the waters” now allowed, founders can gauge demand before commiting</em></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Other businesses will come up with their own ways to solve these problems, because the upside of having your customers as your investors is too great. Gumroad now has hundreds of creators as owners, who are now doubly incentivized to use the product itself more, and spread the word to other creators.</p>
        <p>This isn't hypothetical. In the UK, where the maximum is higher and the financial disclosures required are fewer,  <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CZXdI0Giq1AGsPEG2HTg2t6zU5MrSazEvrpSQ0kcib0/edit#gid=0">crowdfunding is more than 60x the US</a>.</p>
        <p>To be clear: quintupling the crowdfunding cap is not going to 5x crowdfunding, it is going to 50x crowdfunding. Gumroad did not go from raising $1M to raising $5M, but from not raising this way to raising this way. Equity crowdfunding now has product-market fit.</p>
        <h2>How can I help?</h2>
        <p>There <em>is</em> one way to make this happen sooner: show founders that taking this approach will make their companies more valuable.</p>
        <p>So, to Gumroad's 7,303 new investors asking "How can I help?" for the very first time:</p>
