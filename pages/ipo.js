          <strong>The Creator-Owner Economy: Gumroad’s "IPO"</strong>
        </h2>

        <p>Creators deserve to get paid for their work.</p>
        <p>To date, <a href="https://gumroad.com">Gumroad</a> has made it easy by enabling creators to sell digital products, online courses, and memberships directly to their audience. But earning an income isn't the only way to get paid.</p>
        <p>Owning equity in a business is another.</p>
        <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">You’re not going to get rich renting out your time. You must own equity - a piece of a business - to gain your financial freedom.</p>&mdash; Naval (@naval) <a href="https://twitter.com/naval/status/1002103670400417792?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 31, 2018</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>        <h2>Turning creators into owners</h2>
        <p>In 2011, I raised a $1.1M Seed from Silicon Valley folks like Max Levchin, Chris Sacca, and First Round. In 2012 I raised a $7M Series A led by Kleiner Perkins.</p>
        <p>I’ve also failed to raise money. In 2015, after meeting with dozens of investors and getting dozens of nos, we wrote off a Series B and had to either sell, shut down, or get acquired. I <a href="/reflecting">wrote about this decision</a>, saying:</p>
        <blockquote>I was accountable to our creators, our employees, and our investors–in that order.</blockquote>
        <p>Spoiler alert: I chose our creators over our employees and our investors, deciding not to sell the company. Instead, I shrunk the team from 20 to five in order to keep serving our creators.</p>
        <p>It was a painful decision, and in the years since I’ve thought about how to make interests align more cleanly. For example, I’ve recently started to <a href="/work">hire some of our top creators</a>.</p>
        <p>A logical extension: allowing them to become Gumroad investors too.</p>
        <h2>From income to equity</h2>
        <p>As of March 15 2021, the SEC allows companies to raise up to $5M from the public, using Regulation Crowdfunding (Reg CF).</p>
        <p>We took advantage of these new rules as soon as we could, setting a $1K maximum check size due to anticipated demand. Even with that, we hit the new limit in just about 12 hours, from 7,300 investors–including many of our creators.</p>
        <p><img src="/republic.png" style={{margin: "1rem 0"}} /></p>
        <p>Including $1M from Naval Ravikant, Jason Fried, and others, the total amount raised is $6M. We raised this capital at a $100M pre-money valuation.</p>
        <p>I thought about calling this our Series C–for creators, community, crowdfunding, and out of respect for our failed Series B. But it's more accurate to say this is our initial public offering.</p>
        <p>For 79% of our investors, this was their first-ever angel investment. That is over 5,000 newly-minted angel investors, including many who have wanted to do this for a while but have been traditionally excluded.</p>
        <p>Speaking for myself: My life changed when I went from earning an income (labor) to owning equity (capital). It feels good to put my equity where my mouth is and give others a similar experience.</p>
        <p>One more thing: post-IPO liquidity. An underreported fact of Reg CF is that it allows for secondary sales after a 1-year lockup period. Gumroad will soon allow its owners to sell some of their shares to others, if they wish.</p>
        <p>And in that future, perhaps there's no reason to "go public"–in a limited way, we already have.</p>
        <h2>The future of fundraising</h2>
        <p>I hope to see more startups raise money from their customers and communities. And not just startups, but restaurants and coffee shops and bookstores and more mature companies, and even venture capital firms like Arlan Hamilton's Backstage.</p>
        <p>Why isn’t it more common? First off, the legislation is a day old. So it’ll take some time to get people (both founders and retail investors) educated.</p>
        <p>There are other reasons too:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>It requires a lot of financial transparency–<em>I publish our financials already</em></li>
          <li>Having thousands of investors may create external pressure around decision-making around things like moderation, deplatforming, and pricing–<em>We’re very open about our decision-making already with our Open Board Meetings, encouraging feedback</em></li>
          <li>The brand and experience of VCs are often preferred by founders over the general public when selling customers, employees, etc–<em>I’ve raised money from VCs before, and can get the help I need (I’m kind of one myself!)</em></li>
          <li>You need to have high confidence you can reach a large audience of retail investors–<em>With “testing the waters” now allowed, founders can gauge demand before commiting</em></li>
        </ul>
        <p>More businesses will embrace this method to fundraise, because the upside of having customers as owners is too great. Gumroad now has hundreds of customers as owners, who are doubly-incentivized to help make our product better, use the product itself more, and spread the word.</p>
        <p>This is already the case in the UK, where equity crowdfunding is more than <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CZXdI0Giq1AGsPEG2HTg2t6zU5MrSazEvrpSQ0kcib0/edit#gid=0">60x the US crowdfunding market</a> (compared to their respective GDPs).</p>
        <p>To be clear: quintupling the crowdfunding cap is not going to 5x crowdfunding, it is going to 50x crowdfunding. Gumroad did not go from raising $1M to raising $5M, but from not raising this way to raising this way. At least for Gumroad, equity crowdfunding now has product-market fit.</p>
        <h2>How can I help?</h2>
        <p>There is one way to make this happen sooner: show founders that taking this approach will make their companies more valuable.</p>
        <p>So, to Gumroad's 7,303 or so new investors asking "How can I help?" for the very first time:</p>
